description: Kristina Riemer is a computational ecologist working on her PhD at the University of Florida with Dr. Ethan White
---

Kristina Riemer was born in Wisconsin and raised in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. 
She received a B.A. in biology from [Lawrence University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_University)
in 2012, with a focus on aquatic ecology under the guidance of mentor Dr. Bart 
De Stasio. 

Kristina is currently working on her PhD in computational ecology with advisor
[Ethan White](http://whitelab.weecology.org/)
in the [Wildlife Ecology and Conservation department](http://www.wec.ufl.edu/) 
at the University of Florida. She completed the first two years of her PhD with 
the same advisor in the Biology department at Utah State University. 

Kristina's research field is ecology; she currently uses macroecological methods
to investigate the response of species traits to environmental conditions. While
developing her own research and computational skills, she also collaborates 
actively with the other members of the [Weecology lab](http://weecology.org/),
which is jointly run by Drs. [Morgan Ernest](http://ernestlab.weecology.org/)
and Ethan White.
