### Community change

My PhD work has centered around questions about how ecological communities change through time. I used data (data which I also helped collect) from the [Portal Project](http://www.weecology.org/project/portal/), a study site in southeast Arizona that began in 1977 and is still ongoing. At Portal we conduct small mammal (rodent) surveys monthly, plant surveys biannually, and collect climate data continuously through an automated weather station.  

**40 years of a desert rodent community**
In this project, I asked what patterns could be found in 40 years of rodent data. Specifically, I wanted to know if the prevailing overall pattern suggested slow, gradual change (which we might expect given that there was a slow, gradual change in habitat structure over those 40 years), or if change in the rodent community tended to happen in short bursts. 

**Plants, ants, and rodents**
In this project, I compare rodent community dynamics to dynamics from two other communities at the same site: annual plants and seed-eating ants. These three communities are connected not only in that they experience the same abiotic events (e.g. episodic rainfall, temperature extremes), but they also interact with each other: both the rodents and the ants depend on annual plant seeds for food. Determining whether change happens in these three taxa simultaneously, or if they all change independently, provides information as to which of these interactions are important in practice. 

**Incumbency effects**
As habitat changes, animals may have to move around the landscape to find locations that fit their physiological needs. What happens when those new locations are already occupied? Using a set of long-term experimental plots at Portal, I ask what happens when you remove a dominant community member from a patch for a sufficiently long time that the remaining species adjust to its absence, and then allow the dominant species to reinvade. Does the established community slow this process, or even prevent it entirely?
